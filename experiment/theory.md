The potential energy of a triatomic molecule is approximated as follows:

U(x12 , x13 , ¦È) = 0.5 K (x12 - x012)2 + 0.5 K (x13 - x013)2 + 0.5 K¦È (¦È - ¦È0)2

This energy surface ensures that equilibrium geometry of the triatomic molecule is the configuration with least potential energy. The equilibrium geometry is obtained when ¦È = ¦È0, x12 = x012 and x13 = x013.

The internuclear forces can be determined by calculating the negative gradient of U(x12 , x13 , ¦È) with respect to the atomic coordinates of the atoms that are not fixed and their positions are controlled using the optical tweezer.
