The potential energy of a triatomic molecule is approximated as follows:

U(x<sub>12</sub> , x<sub>13</sub> , θ) = 0.5 K (x<sub>12</sub> - x0<sub>12</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + 0.5 K (x<sub>13</sub> - x<sub>013</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + 0.5 K<sub>θ</sub> (θ - θ<sub>0</sub>)<sup>2</sup>

This energy surface ensures that equilibrium geometry of the triatomic molecule is the configuration with least potential energy. The equilibrium geometry is obtained when θ = θ<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>12</sub> = x<sub>012</sub> and x<sub>13</sub> = x<sub>013</sub>. 

The internuclear forces can be determined by calculating the negative gradient of U(x<sub>12</sub> , x<sub>13</sub> , θ) with respect to the atomic coordinates of the atoms that are not fixed and their positions are controlled using the optical tweezer.
